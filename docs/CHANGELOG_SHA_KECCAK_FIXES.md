# SHA/Keccak Implementation Fixes - Change Log

## Overview

Comprehensive audit and fix of the SHA3/Keccak cryptographic implementation across the
Stylus Hardware Anchor codebase. All changes ensure Ethereum-compatible Keccak-256
(0x01 padding) is used consistently from ESP32 firmware through to on-chain Stylus contracts.

## Changes by File

### 1. `ohr_firmware/src/main.cpp` (PlatformIO Firmware)

**Fix: Unaligned Memory Access**
- Replaced unsafe `uint64_t*` pointer casting with byte-wise XOR
- The original code `st[i] ^= ((uint64_t*)input)[i]` causes undefined behavior when
  `input` is not 8-byte aligned
- New code uses `((uint8_t*)st)[i] ^= input[i]` which is safe on all architectures

**Fix: Unused Variable**
- Removed `size_t offset = 0` on line 73 which was declared but never used

**Fix: Hardcoded Chip Model**
- Changed `Serial.printf("Chip Model:           ESP32-S3 (Model %d)\n", ...)` to
  `Serial.printf("Chip Model:           %d\n", ...)` since the code runs on any ESP32 variant

### 2. `ohr_firmware/main/tiny-keccak.c` (NEW - was empty)

**Fix: Empty Implementation File**
- File was 0 bytes, causing linker errors if any sha3.h functions were referenced
- Implemented complete Keccak-f[1600] permutation with all 24 rounds
- Implemented all functions declared in sha3.h:
  - `sha3_224_Init`, `sha3_256_Init`, `sha3_384_Init`, `sha3_512_Init`
  - `sha3_Update` (incremental hashing)
  - `sha3_Final` (NIST SHA3 padding: 0x06)
  - `keccak_Final` (Ethereum Keccak padding: 0x01)
  - `keccak_256`, `keccak_512` (convenience one-shot functions)
  - `sha3_256`, `sha3_512` (convenience one-shot functions)
- Uses byte-wise XOR throughout to avoid alignment issues on ESP32

### 3. `ohr_firmware/main/options.h` (NEW FILE)

**Fix: Missing Header Dependency**
- `sha3.h` includes `options.h` which did not exist, causing compilation failure
- Created with `USE_KECCAK 1` to enable Ethereum-compatible Keccak mode
- Controls whether `keccak_Final` / `keccak_256` / `keccak_512` are compiled

---

### 4. `ohr_firmware/main/anchor_ohr.cpp` (ESP-IDF Firmware)

**Fix: SHA3-256 Replaced with Keccak-256**
- Removed `#include "mbedtls/sha3.h"` (produces wrong hashes for Ethereum)
- Added `#include "sha3.h"` (our Keccak implementation)
- Replaced `anchor_keccak256_placeholder` (which used mbedTLS SHA3-256 with 0x06 padding)
  with `anchor_keccak256` that calls `keccak_256()` (correct 0x01 padding)
- mbedTLS SHA3-256 produces different digests than Solidity's `keccak256()` and
  the Stylus contract's `alloy_primitives::keccak256`

**Fix: Domain Tag Length Mismatch**
- `anchor_HWI_DOMAIN_LEN` changed from 12 to 13
- `anchor_RCT_DOMAIN_LEN` changed from 12 to 13
- The string `"anchor_OHR_V1"` is 13 characters, not 12
- The old value truncated the last character, producing incorrect hash inputs
- Now matches Python verifier and Stylus contract (both use full 13 bytes)

**Fix: Stale Comments Updated**
- Updated docstring comments that still referenced "12 bytes" for domain tags to "13 bytes"
- Removed outdated "placeholder" warnings now that real Keccak is implemented
- Updated security status display to show Keccak-256 as implemented
- Updated production checklist to mark Keccak-256 as done

---

### 5. `ohr_firmware/main/CMakeLists.txt`

**Fix: Build Configuration**
- Added `tiny-keccak.c` to `SRCS` so it gets compiled in the ESP-IDF build
- Removed `mbedtls` from `PRIV_REQUIRES` since hashing no longer depends on it

---

### 6. `oap_witness/Cargo.toml`

**Fix: Invalid Rust Edition**
- Changed `edition = "2024"` to `edition = "2021"`
- Rust edition "2024" does not exist; this caused `cargo build` to fail entirely

---

### 7. `middleware/anchor_middleware.py`

**Fix: Documentation Mismatch**
- Updated comment from "12 bytes, ASCII" to "13 bytes, ASCII" for the domain tag
- Aligns documentation with actual string length of `"anchor_OHR_V1"`

---

### 8. `stylus_anchor/stylus_hardware_anchor/src/lib.rs` (Stylus Contract)

**Fix: Incorrect Vec Pre-allocation**
- Changed `Vec::with_capacity(116)` to `Vec::with_capacity(117)`
- Actual receipt material size: 13 + 32 + 32 + 32 + 8 = 117 bytes
- The old value of 116 assumed a 12-byte domain tag; with 13 bytes it's 117
- Not a functional bug (Vec grows automatically) but corrects the intent

## Cross-Component Consistency Verification

After all fixes, the following was verified to match across every component:

### Domain Tags
```
Firmware (C):    "anchor_RCT_V1"  (13 bytes)
Python:          b"anchor_RCT_V1" (13 bytes)
Stylus (Rust):   b"anchor_RCT_V1" (13 bytes)
```

### Keccak Padding Byte
```
src/main.cpp:       0x01 (Keccak)
tiny-keccak.c:      0x01 (Keccak)
anchor_ohr.cpp:     0x01 (via keccak_256)
Python eth_hash:    0x01 (Keccak)
Stylus keccak256:   0x01 (Keccak)
```

### Receipt Material Layout (117 bytes total)
```
Offset  Size  Field
0       13    Domain tag ("anchor_RCT_V1")
13      32    Hardware identity
45      32    Firmware hash
77      32    Execution hash
109      8    Counter (big-endian uint64)
```

Verified identical ordering in:
- `anchor_ohr.cpp` lines 388-407
- `lib.rs` lines 48-53
- `anchor_verifier.py` lines 217-223
- `generate_test_receipt.py` lines 71-72

## Known Remaining Items (Not Bugs)

These are architectural observations, not defects:

1. **Two Stylus Contracts Exist**
   - `stylus_anchor/src/lib.rs` - Simple contract (sdk 0.10.0, deployed on Sepolia)
   - `stylus_anchor/stylus_hardware_anchor/src/lib.rs` - Full verification contract (sdk 0.6.0)
   - Use `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` from your `.env` to select the active deployment

2. **Environment Variable Conventions**
   - Repository convention is:
     - `RPC_URL`
     - `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
     - `PRIVATE_KEY`

3. **Deployment Addresses**
   - Deployment addresses are environment-specific and should not be hardcoded in the repo
   - Use `.env` for local configuration

4. **Legacy Deployments**
   - Earlier deployments without owner-gated admin functions should be treated as deprecated
   - Current deployments should enforce owner gating and be the only addresses referenced by tooling
