**A protocol-level bridge binding immutable silicon identity to Arbitrum Stylus.**

Stylus Hardware Anchor (SHA) is a reusable hardware identity verification primitive designed for Stylus smart contracts. It cryptographically binds immutable ESP32-S3 eFuse identifiers to on-chain execution logic, enabling deterministic device identity, replay-safe receipts, and firmware-governed access control.

Preliminary benchmark: ~12.5k–29.7k gas per receipt in batched verification on Arbitrum Sepolia (amortization improves with batch size; see BENCHMARKS.md). Stylus enables high-throughput hardware receipt verification via WASM batch execution when applications need to verify many receipts in a single transaction; otherwise, single verification remains available.

## 🏗️ Hardware Identity Primitive for Stylus

SHA provides a structured approach to hardware-bound execution in decentralized systems. By moving from software-only private keys to silicon-bound cryptographic proofs, it enables:

- **Device-Bound Identity:** 1 physical device ↔ 1 on-chain identity  
- **Replay-Safe Receipts:** Monotonic counter enforcement  
- **Firmware Governance:** Execution restricted to approved firmware versions  
- **Deterministic Verification:** Ethereum-compatible Keccak-256 (0x01 padding)

This project is focused on providing reusable infrastructure, not a standalone application.

---

## Current Status

- Prototype deployed on Arbitrum Sepolia  
- Firmware ↔ Python ↔ Stylus cryptographic parity achieved  
- ≥10,000 deterministic test vectors validated  
- Security hardening (Phase 1 — Milestone 1) pending grant approval  

No professional third-party audit has been conducted. Mainnet deployment is not part of the current scope.

## Start Here (Docs Index)

This repo is intentionally **Stylus-first (Rust/WASM)**. For tooling like `cast`, always call the **exported ABI names** (Stylus SDK 0.6.x exports camelCase, e.g. `getOwner`, `authorizeNode`).

Recommended reading order:

1. [`SETUP_GUIDE.md`](SETUP_GUIDE.md)
2. [`docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
3. [`docs/CAST_CHEATSHEET.md`](docs/CAST_CHEATSHEET.md)
4. [`docs/ESP32_FLASH_SAFETY.md`](docs/ESP32_FLASH_SAFETY.md)
5. [`docs/DEBUGGING_POSTMORTEM.md`](docs/DEBUGGING_POSTMORTEM.md)

Configuration is environment-driven:

- `RPC_URL`
- `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
- `PRIVATE_KEY` (never commit; prefer local key files)

## 🧼 Optional (Cleaner Dev Workflow)

For a cleaner development environment with isolated Python dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

`requirements-dev.txt` includes `black` for code formatting and additional testing tools.

## 🛠️ Architecture Overview

### 1️⃣ Silicon Layer (ESP32-S3)

- Extracts manufacturer-burned identifiers (Base MAC + Chip Model)  
- Generates 32-byte Hardware Identity (HW_ID)  
- On-device Keccak-256 (Ethereum-compatible, 0x01 padding)

### 2️⃣ Verification Layer (Stylus / Rust / WASM)

- Reconstructs receipt digests  
- Enforces monotonic counter replay protection  
- Validates firmware hash gating  

### 3️⃣ Middleware Layer (Python SDK — Early Access)

- Device authorization flows  
- Receipt generation utilities  
- On-chain submission helpers

## 🛣️ Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Current Grant Scope  
**$49,000 USD — 6 months — Testnet Only (Arbitrum Sepolia)**

- Milestone 1: Security Hardening  
- Milestone 2: Developer SDK & Integration Tooling  

No professional audit, mainnet deployment, or ecosystem expansion is included in Phase 1.

### Phase 2 — Future Grant (Not in Current Scope)

- Professional third-party security audit  
- Mainnet deployment  
- Hardware reference design  
- Broader ecosystem integrations  

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for full details.

- [TECHNICAL_CHALLENGES.md](docs/TECHNICAL_CHALLENGES.md) — Integration logs  
- [MILESTONE_1.md](docs/MILESTONE_1.md) — Prototype validation evidence  

---

## ⚖️ Scope Clarification

SHA is currently a testnet-deployed prototype.  

Phase 1 focuses on:

- Internal security hardening  
- Reproducible validation artifacts  
- Developer tooling  

Professional audit and mainnet deployment are explicitly deferred to Phase 2.

## 🤝 Development Focus

SHA is being developed as reusable infrastructure for the Arbitrum ecosystem, with a disciplined roadmap toward audit preparation and eventual mainnet deployment, contingent on successful Phase 1 completion.
