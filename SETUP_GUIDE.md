## Step 2: Environment Setup 🖥️

Choose your operating system and follow the corresponding instructions:

### 🪟 Windows Setup

#### A. Install Python 3.x

1. Download Python from [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads)
2. During installation, check **"Add Python to PATH"**
3. Verify installation by opening Command Prompt and typing:

```bash
python --version
```

#### B. Install PlatformIO Core

Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:

```bash
pip install platformio
```

#### C. Install USB Drivers

Most ESP32-S3 boards use CP210x or CH340 USB-to-serial chips. Download and install:

- **CP210x Driver:** https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers
- **CH340 Driver:** https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html

#### D. Setup Python Virtual Environment

Create a dedicated project folder and virtual environment:

```bash
mkdir orthonode_test
cd orthonode_test
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install web3 eth-account eth-hash[pycryptodome]
```

---

### 🍎 macOS Setup

#### A. Install Homebrew (if not installed)

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

#### B. Install Python & PlatformIO

```bash
brew install python3 platformio
```

#### C. Install USB Drivers (if needed)

For CH340-based boards, you may need:

```bash
brew install --cask wch-ch34x-usb-serial-driver
```

#### D. Setup Python Virtual Environment

```bash
mkdir orthonode_test && cd orthonode_test
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install web3 eth-account eth-hash[pycryptodome]
```

---

### 🐧 Linux Setup

#### A. Install Dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv git
pip3 install platformio
```

#### B. Add User to dialout Group

This gives you permission to access USB serial ports without sudo:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Log out and log back in for this change to take effect.

#### C. Setup Python Virtual Environment

```bash
mkdir orthonode_test && cd orthonode_test
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install web3 eth-account eth-hash[pycryptodome]
```

---

## Step 3: Clone the Repository 📦

Now that your environment is set up, clone the SHA repository:

### All Platforms

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orthonode/Stylus-Hardware-Anchor
cd Stylus-Hardware-Anchor
```

### 📂 Repository Structure:

- `ohr_firmware/` — ESP32-S3 firmware code
- `scripts/` — Python authorization scripts
- `contracts/` — Stylus smart contract source (Rust)

---

## Step 4: Connect Your ESP32-S3 🔌

1. Connect your ESP32-S3 to your computer via USB
2. Identify the serial port:

### Windows

Open Device Manager → Ports (COM & LPT)

Look for **COM3**, **COM4**, etc.

### macOS

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
ls /dev/cu.*
```

Look for `/dev/cu.usbserial-XXX` or `/dev/cu.usbmodemXXX`

### Linux

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
ls /dev/ttyUSB* /dev/ttyACM*
```

Look for `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`

---

## Step 5: Flash the Firmware 📲

Navigate to the firmware directory and build/flash:

### Build & Upload

```bash
cd ohr_firmware
pio run --target upload
```

⏱️ **Expected Time:** 2-5 minutes for first-time build

### What Happens During Flashing

- PlatformIO downloads ESP32-S3 toolchain (first time only)
- Compiles the firmware from source
- Uploads binary to your ESP32-S3 via USB
- Device automatically reboots with new firmware

### ✅ Success Indicator:

You should see output ending with:

```
SUCCESS
```

---

## Step 6: Extract Your Hardware ID 🔑

Your ESP32-S3's unique identity is generated from its eFuse MAC address. Let's extract it:

### Open Serial Monitor

```bash
pio device monitor --baud 115200
```

### What You'll See

The device will output diagnostic information. Look for a line like this:

```
Hardware Identity: 0x52fdfc072182654f163f5f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f
```

> 📋 **Important:** Copy this entire 64-character hexadecimal string. You will need it for authorization.

### Understanding the Hardware ID

This identity is:

- **Unique:** Derived from factory-burned eFuse MAC address
- **Permanent:** Cannot be changed or cloned
- **Deterministic:** Same device always produces the same ID

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Press `Ctrl+C` (`Cmd+C` on macOS) to exit the serial monitor.

---

## Step 7: Configure Authorization 🔐

Before authorizing your hardware on-chain, you need to set up your wallet credentials:

### Export Your Private Key

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click the three dots → Account Details → Show Private Key
3. Enter your password and copy the key

> ⚠️ **Security Warning:** Never share your private key. This is for testnet only. Use a separate wallet for testing, not your main wallet with real funds.

### Set Environment Variable

**Windows (Command Prompt):**

```bash
set PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_without_0x
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key_without_0x"
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Remove the `0x` prefix from your private key before setting the variable.

---

## Step 8: Authorize Your Hardware On-Chain ⛓️

Now for the moment of truth! Let's register your hardware on the Arbitrum Sepolia blockchain:

### Run Authorization Script

Navigate to the scripts directory:

```bash
cd ../scripts
```

Run the authorization script with your Hardware ID:

```bash
python authorize_hardware.py --hw-id YOUR_COPIED_HARDWARE_ID
```

*Replace `YOUR_COPIED_HARDWARE_ID` with the 64-character hex string you copied from the serial monitor.*

### What Happens Next

1. Script connects to Arbitrum Sepolia RPC
2. Creates and signs authorization transaction
3. Submits transaction to the blockchain
4. Waits for transaction confirmation

### Expected Output

```
Transaction sent: 0x...
Waiting for confirmation...
✅ Hardware Authorized!
Transaction Hash: 0xabc123...
```

### 🎉 Success!

Your hardware is now authorized on the Arbitrum blockchain!

---

## Step 9: Verify On-Chain 🔍

Let's verify that your hardware authorization was recorded on the blockchain:

### View on Arbiscan

1. Copy your transaction hash from the output
2. Visit [sepolia.arbiscan.io](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io)
3. Paste your transaction hash in the search bar
4. You should see your authorization transaction with status **Success**

### Alternative: View Contract State

You can also view the contract directly:

1. Visit: https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/$CONTRACT_ADDRESS
2. Click **"Read Contract"**
3. Query `isNodeAuthorized` with your hardware ID

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Port Not Detected

**Problem:** ESP32-S3 not showing up in port list

**Solutions:**

- Try a different USB cable (some cables are power-only)
- Install CH340 or CP210x drivers (see Step 2)
- Try a different USB port
- On Linux, ensure you're in the dialout group and logged out/in

---

### Flash Failed / Permission Denied

**Problem:** Upload fails with permission error

**Solutions:**

- **Windows:** Close any serial monitor programs, run as Administrator
- **macOS:** Grant Terminal full disk access in System Preferences → Security
- **Linux:** Verify dialout group membership, use `sudo pio run --target upload` as last resort

---

### Private Key / Web3 Errors

**Problem:** "Invalid private key" or connection errors

**Solutions:**

- Ensure private key has NO `0x` prefix
- Verify environment variable is set: `echo $PRIVATE_KEY` (Unix) or `echo %PRIVATE_KEY%` (Windows)
- Check your internet connection
- Verify you have Arbitrum Sepolia ETH in your wallet

---

### Verification Hash Mismatch

**Problem:** "Digest Mismatch" when verifying receipts

**If you see a mismatch:**

- Ensure domain tag is **13 bytes** (`"anchor_RCT_V1"`) and receipt material is **117 bytes**.
- Keccak-256 must use **Ethereum-compatible padding (0x01)** everywhere (firmware, Python, Stylus).
- Baseline cryptographic parity has been achieved across the stack; report persistent mismatches as bugs.

---
